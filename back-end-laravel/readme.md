## Trippi

It is built on top of three big guys:

* JWT-Auth - [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
* Dingo API - [dingo/api](https://github.com/dingo/api)
* Laravel-CORS [barryvdh/laravel-cors](http://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors)

Its really simple: an integration of these three packages and a setup of some authentication and credentials recovery methods.

## Installation

1. run `git clone https://github.com/MouadBH/trippi.git`
2. Go to the project directory and run `composer install`
3. Create `.env` file by copying the `.env.example`. You may use the command to do that `cp .env.example .env`
5. have a coffee, nothing to do here;
4. Update the database name and credentials in `.env` file 
6. Generat JWT key `php artisan jwt:generate`
7. Link storage directory: `php artisan storage:link`

Once the project creation procedure will be completed, run the `php artisan migrate` command to install the required tables.

## Main Features

### Ready-To-Use Authentication Controllers

You don't have to worry about authentication and password recovery anymore. I created four controllers you can find in the `App\Api\V1\Controllers` for those operations.

For each controller there's an already setup route in `routes/api.php` file:

* `POST api/auth/login`, to do the login and get your access token;
* `POST api/auth/refresh`, to refresh an existent access token by getting a new one;
* `POST api/auth/signup`, to create a new user into your application;
* `POST api/auth/recovery`, to recover your credentials;
* `POST api/auth/reset`, to reset your password after the recovery;
* `POST api/auth/logout`, to log out the user by invalidating the passed token;
* `GET api/auth/me`, to get current user data;

### Separate File for Routes

All the API routes can be found in the `routes/api.php` file.

### Secrets Generation

Every time you create a new project starting from this repository, the _php artisan jwt:generate_ command will be executed.

## Configuration

You can find all the boilerplate specific settings in the `config/boilerplate.php` config file.

```php
<?php

return [

    // these options are related to the sign-up procedure
    'sign_up' => [
        
        // this option must be set to true if you want to release a token
        // when your user successfully terminates the sign-in procedure
        'release_token' => env('SIGN_UP_RELEASE_TOKEN', false),
        
        // here you can specify some validation rules for your sign-in request
        'validation_rules' => [
            'name' => 'required',
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required'
        ]
    ],

    // these options are related to the login procedure
    'login' => [
        
        // here you can specify some validation rules for your login request
        'validation_rules' => [
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required'
        ]
    ],

    // these options are related to the password recovery procedure
    'forgot_password' => [
        
        // here you can specify some validation rules for your password recovery procedure
        'validation_rules' => [
            'email' => 'required|email'
        ]
    ],

    // these options are related to the password recovery procedure
    'reset_password' => [
        
        // this option must be set to true if you want to release a token
        // when your user successfully terminates the password reset procedure
        'release_token' => env('PASSWORD_RESET_RELEASE_TOKEN', false),
        
        // here you can specify some validation rules for your password recovery procedure
        'validation_rules' => [
            'token' => 'required',
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required|confirmed'
        ]
    ]

];
```

There are some extra options that I placed in a _config/boilerplate.php_ file:

* `sign_up.release_token`: set it to `true` if you want your app release the token right after the sign up process;
* `reset_password.release_token`: set it to `true` if you want your app release the token right after the password reset process;

There are also the validation rules for every action (login, sign up, recovery and reset). Feel free to customize it for your needs.

## Creating Endpoints

You can create endpoints in the same way you could to with using the single _dingo/api_ package. You can <a href="https://github.com/dingo/api/wiki/Creating-API-Endpoints" target="_blank">read its documentation</a> for details. After all, that's just a boilerplate! :)

However, I added some example routes to the `routes/api.php` file to give you immediately an idea.

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

If you want to enable CORS for a specific route or routes group, you just have to use the _cors_ middleware on them.

Thanks to the _barryvdh/laravel-cors_ package, you can handle CORS easily. Just check <a href="https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors" target="_blank">the docs at this page</a> for more info.
